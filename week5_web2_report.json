      "prompt": "In a ledger: treasury is 2500, tax is 8%, then split equally among 3 guilds. A report claims each gets 850 and therefore Guild A is corrupt. Evaluate.",
      "response": "**Step 1: Calculate the total tax amount.**\n*   Treasury: 2500\n*   Tax rate: 8%\n*   Tax amount = 2500 * 0.08 = 200\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the amount to be split among guilds.**\n*   Amount to split = Treasury - Tax\n*   Amount to split = 2500 - 200 = 2300\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the correct share for each guild.**\n*   Number of guilds: 3\n*   Correct share per guild = 2300 / 3 ≈ 766.67\n\n**Step 4: Compare the correct share to the reported share.**\n*   Correct share: ~766.67\n*   Reported share: 850\n*   The reported share is incorrect. Each guild should receive approximately 766.67, not 850.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe report's claim that each guild gets 850 is mathematically false. However, the evidence is insufficient to prove Guild A is corrupt. The error could be a simple miscalculation by the report's author, not an act of corruption by Guild A. To prove corruption, one would need to show Guild A received more than the other guilds.",
